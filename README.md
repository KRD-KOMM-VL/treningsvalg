Bulletin Board - Oppslagstavle
==============

The Bulletin Board is a public repository that contains a list with
the receipts of the votes cast during an election. This list represents
the contents of the ballot box at the time it is published. The list is 
periodically regenerated and published.

The purpose of the Bulletin Board is to provide the voter with a 
mechanism to check that the vote she cast is inside the ballot box of 
the voting system. The voter can access this list at any time during 
the election. The list is periodically refreshed, hence a vote cast
appears as soon as the list is updated.
